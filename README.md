# BRIEF DESCRIPTION: 

This is a Food4U team's project for University of Manitoba's devClub 2025 hackathon.
It implements a system which allows the small businesses to search for local food suppliers (in particular, farmers) and connect with them in order to source the food products directly and more efficiently for their business.


# IMPLEMENTATION:  

The system uses SQLlite-implemented databases to store the information of users (small businesses), suppliers, reviews of suppliers, authentification details and products information.  
Below is the schema of the used database:

Also, a Django framework is used for managing the database, handling user's requests and serving the webpages.
In addition, web technologies, such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript (JS) are used for implementing the user-interface (via webpages).
